## How to Build ⬅️
### You will need a Openweathermap.org API (Free)
run `git clone https://github.com/dumpydev/weather.git`  

Now add a file in /lib/ call it 'secrets.dart'       
put your key like `var apikey = 'your_api_key`   
run `flutter build apk`       
Go to the `build\outputs\flutter-apk\` folder and run `adb install app-release.apk`
